# Academic Outcome Analyzer (ML Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes student academic and lifestyle attributes to estimate final academic outcomes using supervised machine learning models.

The objective is educational: to understand data preprocessing, feature relationships, model comparison, and evaluation metrics in a real-world academic dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized student-related attributes such as:
- Demographics
- Study habits
- Family and social factors
- Academic history

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training (KNN, SVM, etc.)  
5. Evaluation and comparison  

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Open `analysis.ipynb`  
4. Run cells sequentially
